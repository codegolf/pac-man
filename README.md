A simple variation of the Pac-Man game almost completely made with [140byt.es](http://140byt.es/) snippets. Collect all points to win the game. Avoid the ghost.

My `getFirstElement` is based on @jed's [cssSelect](https://gist.github.com/991057). Everything else is created from scratch. Tested with Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer 8.

Optional graphics are supported and [can be downloaded here](http://maettig.com/code/javascript/pac-man-in-140byt.es.zip).
